I am a patient with age-related macular degeneration (AMD): what is AMD?,"As the name suggests, it is an eye disease that affects the part of the macula responsible for the central vision. As we grow older, the normal metabolic processes are disturbed, thus waste products end up accumulating at the interface between the choroid and the retina, affecting their function, which further translates into a decreased visual acuity. There are two types of AMD: dry or atrophic AMD, characterized by a slow progression and wet or neovascular AMD usually with a fast evolution.",Age related macular degeneration. It refers to a disease of the retina where the central visual acuity is affected. It is a common cause for blindness,"AMD is a chronic, progressive degenerative disorder of the macula, the central part of the retina, responsible for sharp, central vision, that affects older individuals, usually over the age of 50 and features blurring or loss of central vision in one or both eyes",Reviewer 1,"""Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a common eye condition and a leading cause of vision loss among people age 50 and older. It causes damage to the macula, a small area near the center of the retina that's necessary for sharp, straight-ahead vision, which is needed for activities like reading, driving and recognizing faces.

In some people, AMD advances so slowly that symptoms are barely noticeable. In others, the disease progresses faster and may lead to a loss of vision in both eyes.

There are two types of AMD:

1. Dry AMD (Atrophic): This form is characterised by the presence of yellow deposits, called drusen, in the macula. As these drusen grow in size or number, they may cause a dimming or distortion of vision that's most noticeable when reading.

2. Wet AMD (Neovascular): This form, also called neovascular AMD, occurs when new blood vessels grow into the retina. These vessels can leak fluid or blood, leading to scarring of the macula and rapid, severe damage. Wet AMD causes most cases of severe vision loss related to AMD.

There are various treatment options available for both types of AMD that can help slow the progression of the disease. It's crucial to have regular eye exams to detect the disease early and start treatment as soon as possible.

AMD affects the macula, which is a small area in the centre of the retina at the back of the eye. The macula is responsible for central vision, which is needed for activities such as reading, driving, and recognising faces.

There are two main types of AMD:

* **Dry AMD:** This is the most common type of AMD and affects around 80% of people with the condition. Dry AMD develops slowly and causes the macula to become thinner and less able to function properly.
* **Wet AMD:** This is a less common but more severe type of AMD that affects around 20% of people with the condition. Wet AMD develops when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula and leak blood and fluid. This can cause the macula to become damaged and lead to a rapid loss of central vision.

Intermediate AMD is the stage between early and late AMD. Typically, a person with intermediate AMD might not notice any vision loss because the disease may not produce symptoms at this stage. However, an eye care professional could detect signs of AMD through a thorough eye exam. The exam might find large drusen, which are yellow deposits beneath the retina and symptoms of medium-sized drusen that are about the width of an average human hair. These are usually an indication of Age-Related Macular Degeneration.

",4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0," According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, there are three stages of age-related macular degeneration (AMD): early, intermediate, and late.  

Early AMD is characterized by the presence of drusen, which are small yellow deposits in the macula. Drusen are common and do not usually cause vision loss. 

Intermediate AMD is characterized by the presence of more drusen and other changes in the macula, such as pigmentary changes and thinning of the retinal tissue. These changes can cause some vision loss, but it is usually mild. 

Late AMD is characterized by the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), which is the growth of new blood vessels under the macula. CNV can cause severe vision loss. 

If you have been diagnosed with intermediate AMD, it is important to see your doctor regularly to monitor your condition and to receive treatment if necessary.

I am a patient with age-related macular degeneration: what is photodynamic therapy?,"This is a special treatment used in several eye diseases, one of them, being neovascular AMD. A specific drug called verteporfin, is injected into a vein of the arm. This substance accumulates in the abnormal blood vessels. The laser will be shone into the eye, the drug is activated by it, and blood clots will be created in the abnormal blood vessels, closing the vessels. ","It is a form of therapy that uses verteporfin, a light activated compound preferenatially taken up by dividing cells as seen in neovascular tissues.","Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a treatment is specifically used in cases of neovascular AMD, which involves the growth of new and abnormal blood vessel beneath the retina. It uses light along with chemicals (known as photosensitizers) to produce site-specific vascular occlusion and break down the abnormal blood vessels. Photosensitizers can destroy nearby cells when they come into contact with certain wavelengths of light. Photodynamic therapy is recommended only as a possible therapy for the wet type of AMD. Photodynamic therapy cannot restore vision that has already been lost, but it may slow down the damage to the central vision.",Reviewer 1,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a medical treatment that uses a photosensitizing molecule (usually a drug that becomes activated by light exposure) and a light source to activate the administered drug. 

In the context of age-related macular degeneration, particularly the 'wet' type, PDT can be utilized to help stabilize vision.

Here's a simplified overview of the procedure:

1. A photosensitive drug called verteporfin is injected into the bloodstream.
2. The drug circulates throughout the body, including the new blood vessels in the eye, where it binds to proteins within these vessels.
3. About 15 minutes post-injection, a doctor shines a non-thermal laser (a light, not heat, producing laser) into the eye.
4. This activates the drug, prompting it to break down and destroy these abnormal blood vessels without causing significant damage to the overlying sensory layer of the eye.

PDT helps to slow the progression of the disease and reduce vision loss. However, it typically doesn't restore vision that has already been lost and often requires multiple treatments over time.

Always consult with your eye care professional or healthcare provider for precise information and to know if this treatment is appropriate for your specific situation.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0," Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a treatment for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) that uses a combination of light and a photosensitizing drug to destroy abnormal blood vessels in the eye.

When the light is shone into the eye, it activates the drug and causes the abnormal blood vessels to close off.

PDT is typically used to treat wet AMD, which is a more advanced form of the disease that can lead to vision loss. The goal of PDT is to stop the growth of new abnormal blood vessels and to prevent further damage to the macula, which is the part of the eye responsible for central vision.

PDT is a relatively safe and effective treatment for wet AMD. However, there are some risks associated with the procedure, such as bleeding, infection, and vision loss.

You should always discuss changes in your diet with your healthcare provider or a nutritionist, who can provide information based on your specific health status and needs. 

Please note: These dietary modifications are not a treatment or cure for geographic atrophy, but they may help support overall eye health. Nonetheless, you should continue following the treatment plan provided by your ophthalmologist and report any visual changes promptly.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0," Geographic atrophy is an eye condition that affects the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp central vision. It is caused by the death of retinal cells and can lead to vision loss. 

Although there is no specific diet that can cure or prevent geographic atrophy, some dietary changes may help to slow the progression of the condition and protect the remaining retinal cells. 

- Leafy green vegetables: Leafy green vegetables, such as spinach, kale, and collard greens, are rich in lutein and zeaxanthin, two antioxidants that have been shown to protect the retina from damage. 
- Omega-3 fatty acids: Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish, nuts, and seeds, have anti-inflammatory properties that may help to protect the retina. 
- Fruits: Fruits, especially berries, are a good source of antioxidants that can help to protect the retina from damage. 
- Whole grains: Whole grains are a good source of fiber, which can help to lower cholesterol and blood pressure. High cholesterol and blood pressure can increase the risk of developing geographic atrophy. 
- Water: Drinking plenty of water is important for overall health and can help to keep the eyes hydrated. 

It is also important to avoid foods that are high in saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium, as these can increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, which can also increase the risk of geographic atrophy. 

If you have geographic atrophy, it is important to talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian about developing a diet that is right for you.",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,,31,I am a patient with geographic atrophy in the right eye: should I change my diet?,About diet and lifestyle,Patient diagnosed

A number of studies have shown that taking a supplement containing lutein and zeaxanthin can help to protect the macula from damage. Lutein and zeaxanthin are carotenoids, which are natural pigments found in high concentrations in the macula. They are thought to act as antioxidants, protecting the macula from damage caused by free radicals.

One of the largest studies to investigate the effects of lutein and zeaxanthin on AMD was the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS). This study found that taking a supplement containing 10 mg of lutein, 2 mg of zeaxanthin, 500 mg of vitamin C, 400 IU of vitamin E, and 80 mg of zinc significantly reduced the risk of developing advanced AMD by 25%.

Another large study, the Carotenoids in Age-Related Eye Disease Study (CAREDS), found that taking a supplement containing 12 mg of lutein and 10 mg of zeaxanthin significantly reduced the risk of developing advanced AMD by 40%.

Here are the usual stages:

1. Early AMD: Most people do not experience vision loss in the early stage of AMD, often termed ""dry"" AMD. It's usually diagnosed via presence of medium-sized drusen -- yellow deposits beneath the retina.

2. Intermediate AMD: There may be some vision loss, but there still may be no noticeable symptoms. Larger drusen and/or pigment changes in the retina signal the progression to this stage.

Lutein is found in high concentrations in the macula, a small area of the retina responsible for central vision. It helps protect the eye from damage caused by free radicals and blue light.

2. Zeaxanthin: Zeaxanthin, like lutein, is found in high concentrations in the macula and is also obtained from diet, especially from green vegetables and some fruits. This nutrient helps to safeguard the eye from harmful high-energy light waves such as ultraviolet rays in sunlight.

3. Beta-Carotene: This is a type of carotenoid that the body can convert into Vitamin A, which is essential for vision, helping the retina function smoothly. Beta-carotene also has antioxidant properties, meaning it can protect cells from the damage caused by harmful free radicals. It's found in many fruits and vegetables, especially those that are bright orange, like carrots and pumpkins.

For managing age-related macular degeneration, medical professionals often recommend a diet high in these antioxidants or supplementation in the correct dosage under supervision. Always consult a healthcare provider before starting any new dietary supplement regimen.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0," Lutein, zeaxanthin, and beta-carotene are carotenoids, which are natural substances found in plants. They are important for eye health, and they are found in high concentrations in the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp central vision. Lutein and zeaxanthin are the most abundant carotenoids in the macula, and they are thought to protect the macula from damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) light and other environmental stressors. Beta-carotene is converted to vitamin A in the body, which is also essential for eye health. 

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss in older adults. It is characterized by the breakdown of the macula, leading to blurred vision, difficulty reading, and problems with color perception. Studies have shown that lutein, zeaxanthin, and beta-carotene may help to protect against AMD. For example, the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) found that taking a daily supplement containing lutein, zeaxanthin, beta-carotene, and other nutrients reduced the risk of developing advanced AMD by 25%.

From this stage, the disease tipically progresses slowly, taking approximately 5 to 10 years to develop an advanced stage of AMD. The advanced forms are often symptomatic with loss of contrast sensitivity, blurred, distorted, or blank spots in the central vision, difficulty seeing details, difficulty reading or any other activity which requires fine vision (despite wearing glasses), difficulty distinguishing faces, straight lines appearing wavy. AMD also has the potential for bilateral involvement, so regular eye exams are crucial for monitoring both eyes.",Reviewer 1,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) primarily affects your central vision. This is the vision you use to focus on details in front of you, such as faces, text, or television. Peripheral (side) vision is usually not affected.

In the early stages of AMD, you might not notice any symptoms at all. It's often only detected during regular eye-examinations. As the condition advances, you may start to notice symptoms, often in one eye first. These may include:

- Blurred or fuzzy vision
- Difficulty recognizing faces
- Distorted images (straight lines may appear wavy, for example)
- A dark or empty area appearing in the center of your visual field

AMD may progress slowly in some people but more quickly in others. How much your vision will be affected depends on the progression of the disease; not everyone will experience complete loss of central vision. However, even advanced AMD does not lead to complete blindness since peripheral vision is not affected.

There is no cure for AMD, but there are treatments that may slow its progression. These include certain medications, laser therapy, and  making lifestyle changes (like quitting smoking and eating a healthy diet rich in leafy greens and fish) can also help manage the condition.

Your healthcare provider or ophthalmologist can provide more precise information based on your specific condition, so please do not hesitate to reach out to them for detailed advice.

AMD can cause blurred vision, difficulty reading, and problems with color perception. In some cases, AMD can lead to severe vision loss.

There are two main types of AMD: dry AMD and wet AMD. Dry AMD is the most common form of the disease, and it affects about 85% of people with AMD. Dry AMD causes the macula to become thin and brittle, leading to the formation of small yellow deposits called drusen. Drusen are not harmful, but they can be a sign of early AMD.

Wet AMD is a less common but more severe form of the disease. It occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula. These blood vessels can leak fluid and blood, damaging the macula and causing rapid vision loss.

The symptoms of AMD can vary depending on the type and stage of the disease. In early AMD, people may notice that their vision is slightly blurred or that they have difficulty reading small print. As the disease progresses, people may experience more significant vision loss, making it difficult to perform everyday tasks such as driving or recognizing faces.

In some cases, AMD can lead to severe vision loss, making it difficult to see objects clearly or to perform daily activities. However, it is important to note that AMD does not usually cause complete blindness.

The progression of AMD can vary widely from person to person. Some people may experience a slow progression of the disease, while others may experience a more rapid decline in vision. There is no cure for AMD, but there are treatments available that can help to slow the progression of the disease and prevent vision loss.

Intermediate AMD commonly does not have vision loss, but it's possible to have some vision problems. You may experience slight vision loss or blurriness, difficulty adapting to low lights, or trouble recognizing faces. Other symptoms might include the requirement for brighter light for reading and other tasks, an increased perception of blurriness or hazy vision, or a blunted or diminished intensity of colors.

In the future, if the condition progresses to late-stage AMD, either dry or wet, significant vision loss or blindness could occur. Dry AMD, which is the more common type, involves the thinning of the macula, which causes blurry or reduced central vision. Wet AMD is more serious and occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow under the retina, leading to more rapid vision loss.

Regular eye exams and following your healthcare provider's instructions can help monitor the progression of the disease and potentially slow it down. There are also several treatments available for late AMD that can slow down the progression of vision loss, including anti-VEGF injections for wet AMD and laser surgery in certain cases.

This is the most effective way to manage neovascular AMD and represents the first line-treatment. The primary goal of anti-VEGF agents, injected intravitreally, is to block the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the eye to prevent visual loss and, in some instances, improve vision. Anti-VEGF therapy is generally well tolerated and rarely associated with serious adverse events. However, its efficacy seems highly dependent on an early diagnosis of neovascular lesions before major retinal damage has occurred. Laser photocoagulation can be used to obtain closure of subretinal neovascular membranes resulting in permanent cessation of exudation, hemorrhage and vessel growth, but is can only be used in extrafoveal forms of the disease. Nowadays, its use is less common due to the best results of anti-VEGF therapies, being limited to exceptional cases and usually as a combination therapy with anti-VEGF.

Anti-VEGF injections: Anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) injections are the most common treatment for nAMD. VEGF is a protein that promotes the growth of new blood vessels in the eye, which can cause vision loss. Anti-VEGF injections block the action of VEGF, preventing the growth of new blood vessels and reducing leakage from existing ones.

Several nutritional supplements, like specific vitamins and antioxidants, may be recommended to help slow down the progression of the disease. Healthy lifestyle choices such as not smoking, eating a balanced diet rich in leafy green vegetables, and regular exercise can also contribute to a healthier macula.

There are also several new therapies under investigation that are expected to enter clinical use in the next few years. These include complement inhibitors, visual cycle modulators, neuroprotective agents, and stem cell-based therapies, among others.

It's important to note that the course of treatment or management strategies should be determined by a healthcare professional based on the individual characteristics and needs of the patient.

Unfortunately, there is currently no cure for GA, but there are some treatments that can help to slow the progression of the disease and preserve vision.

One treatment option is anti-VEGF therapy, which involves injecting a medication into the eye to block the growth of abnormal blood vessels. This can help to reduce fluid build-up and inflammation in the retina, which can lead to vision loss.

Another treatment option is photodynamic therapy (PDT), which involves injecting a light-sensitive dye into the eye and then using a laser to activate the dye. This can help to destroy abnormal blood vessels and reduce inflammation.

Finally, there are a number of nutritional supplements that have been shown to help to slow the progression of GA. These include lutein, zeaxanthin, and omega-3 fatty acids.

It is important to note that these treatments can only slow the progression of GA, and they cannot restore vision that has already been lost.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common eye condition that affects the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp central vision. AMD is the leading cause of sight loss in the UK and US and is more common in older adults. 

There are two main types of AMD: dry AMD and wet AMD. Dry AMD is the earlier stage of the condition and is characterized by the presence of drusen, small yellow deposits in the macula. Wet AMD is a more advanced stage of the condition and occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula, leading to leakage of fluid and blood. 

The risk of losing reading vision in the next 5 years for a patient with intermediate AMD in the right eye with 20/20 vision is approximately 10%. This risk is based on the patient's age, the stage of AMD, and the presence of other risk factors, such as smoking and high blood pressure. 

It is important to note that the risk of losing reading vision is not the same for everyone with AMD. Some people may progress to wet AMD and lose reading vision quickly, while others may remain stable for many years.

Please follow your eye doctor's instructions closely and keep regular appointments to monitor the condition. Also, remember that support and resources are available to help those experiencing vision loss.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0," Geographic atrophy (GA) is an eye condition that affects the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp central vision. GA is characterized by the loss of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells and photoreceptors, the light-sensing cells in the retina. This loss of cells leads to the formation of geographic-shaped areas of atrophy, or thinning, in the macula.

GA is a chronic, slowly progressive condition, meaning it tends to worsen over time. However, the rate of progression can vary widely from person to person. Some people may experience a rapid decline in vision, while others may have a more stable course.

In general, GA does not lead to complete blindness. However, it can cause significant vision loss, particularly in the central field of vision. This can make it difficult to perform activities that require good central vision, such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces.

There is currently no cure for GA, but there are treatments that can help to slow the progression of the disease and preserve vision. These treatments include:

Anti-VEGF injections: These injections are used to block the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the retina. Abnormal blood vessels can leak fluid and cause damage to the macula. Anti-VEGF injections can help to reduce fluid leakage and preserve vision.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT): PDT is a laser treatment that is used to destroy abnormal blood vessels in the retina. PDT can be used in combination with anti-VEGF injections to treat GA.

Low-vision rehabilitation: Low-vision rehabilitation can help people with GA to make the most of their remaining vision. This can include training in the use of adaptive devices and strategies for coping with vision loss.

If you have been diagnosed with GA, it is important to see an eye doctor regularly to monitor the progression of the disease and to discuss treatment options. Early detection and treatment can help to preserve vision and improve your quality of life.",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,,87,I am a patient with geographic atrophy in the right eye: am I going to become blind?,About changes in vision,Patient diagnosed

However, it's important to note that having a condition like neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) can complicate the situation.

AMD affects the macula, the part of the retina responsible for your central field of vision. Even if a cataract surgery is successful, it may not improve vision if the macula is significantly damaged due to the AMD. On the other hand, if the cataract is obstructing the view of the retina, then removing it may help in better management of your AMD.

As this is a complex issue, you should discuss this with your ophthalmologist or retinal specialist. They can assess the specifics of your condition and give you advice tailored to your individual circumstances. Ultimately, the decision would be based upon assessing the potential benefits of the cataract surgery against its potential risks, given your overall eye health and the progression of your AMD.

AMD affects the central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving and recognising faces.  Cataracts are a clouding of the naturally clear lens in your eye that can cause blurred vision, glare and difficulty seeing in low light.  They usually occur in older people. 

Cataract surgery is a common and effective treatment for cataracts.  During the surgery, the cloudy lens is removed and replaced with a clear artificial lens.  This can significantly improve vision and reduce glare.  However, cataract surgery will not improve the vision loss caused by AMD.  This is because AMD affects the macula, which is the part of the retina responsible for central vision.  Cataract surgery can only improve the vision loss caused by the cataract.

In your case, you have neovascular AMD in the right eye, with 20/200 vision and with moderately dense cataract.  This means that you have a significant amount of vision loss in your right eye due to AMD.

Geographic atrophy is a type of advanced age-related macular degeneration that can cause severe vision loss. Surgery can't typically improve the lost vision caused by geographic atrophy as it affects the retina, not the lens. Therefore, it is possible that even after successful cataract surgery, your vision may remain limited due to underlying retinal disease.

Particularly in neovascular AMD you should avoid any delay as it can lead to rapid and severe vision loss if not addressed promptly. Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) may be partially reversible with intravitreal injection therapy using anti-VEGF agents (e.g. aflibercept, bevacizumab, ranibizumab). This is the most effective way to manage neovascular AMD and represents the first line-treatment. The primary goal of anti-VEGF agents, injected intravitreally, is to block the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the eye to prevent visual loss and, in some instances, improve vision. Anti-VEGF therapy is generally well tolerated and rarely associated with serious adverse events.

Neovascular AMD, also known as wet AMD, is typically treated with injections into the eye to block a protein called Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), which aids in the formation of new blood vessels. This is likely the treatment you've received with injections of Bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF drug.

If your condition is still showing sign of disease activity and your vision is not improving, your doctor may consider other treatment options:

1. Change of drug: Treatment effectiveness varies between individuals and sometimes, a different anti-VEGF drug such as Ranibizumab (Lucentis) or Aflibercept (Eylea) might work better for you.

2. Photodynamic therapy: This involves injecting a light-sensitive drug into the bloodstream, which gets absorbed by the abnormal blood vessels in the eye. The doctor then shines a special light into your eye, which activates the drug to destroy the abnormal blood vessels.

3. Laser surgery: In certain cases, laser surgery may be used to destroy the abnormal, leaking blood vessels in the eye.

The choice of treatment depends on the specific characteristics of theAMD and the patient's overall health.

Remember, it's crucial to discuss these options with your eye specialist to choose a treatment course that best suits your case. Lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, and smoking cessation can also support overall eye health. 

Also, I want to remind you that due to the neovascular nature of AMD, the disease naturally tends to wax and wane over time, and vision fluctuations are possible.

Switch to a different anti-VEGF medication: If you are not responding well to Bevacizumab, your doctor may recommend switching to a different anti-VEGF medication, such as Ranibizumab (Lucentis) or Aflibercept (Eylea). These medications work in a similar way to Bevacizumab, but may have different side effects or be more effective in some patients.

3. Consider a combination therapy: In some cases, your doctor may recommend combining anti-VEGF therapy with another type of treatment, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) or laser therapy. These treatments can help to destroy abnormal blood vessels and reduce inflammation in the eye.

4. Surgery: If the other treatment options are not effective, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove the abnormal blood vessels in the eye. This is usually done as a last resort, as it carries a higher risk of complications.

The typical treatment for this condition is anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) medications, which are designed to block the formation of new abnormal blood vessels in the eye and to slow the leakage from these vessels. 

These medications are typically injected directly into the eye by a retinal specialist. The frequency of the injections can vary from every month, every other month, or in some cases, less frequently, depending on how your eye responds to treatment.

Regarding the timing of treatment, it generally should start as soon as possible after diagnosis, as the condition can lead to further vision loss if not treated promptly. However, the exact timing would depend on various factors including your overall health, the specifics of your condition, and the recommendation of your eye specialist.

As every case is different, it is imperative to have this conversation with your healthcare provider or ophthalmologist, who knows your case best. They can provide you with a more personalized discussion regarding treatment and timeline. If you are noticing any changes or worsening in your vision, it's important to reach out to your healthcare provider immediately.

Remember, this is a generalized explanation and should not be used as personalized medical advice as each case will be dependent on your detailed individual circumstances and medical history. Always consult with your healthcare provider for anything concerning your health.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0," As a patient with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in the right eye who experienced sudden vision loss two weeks ago, it is important to seek medical attention from a retinal specialist as soon as possible. The sudden loss of vision in one eye is a common symptom of a condition called choroidal neovascularization (CNV), which is a growth of abnormal blood vessels beneath the retina that can cause damage to the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp central vision.

Regarding the timing of treatment, it is crucial to start treatment for neovascular AMD without delay to prevent further damage to the macula and preserve vision. The treatment options for neovascular AMD have evolved significantly in recent years, and there are several effective medications available that can help stabilize or improve vision.

One common treatment option for neovascular AMD is anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. VEGF is a protein that plays a key role in the growth of abnormal blood vessels. Anti-VEGF medications work by blocking the action of VEGF, thereby inhibiting the growth of new blood vessels and reducing leakage from existing ones. These medications are typically administered through injections into the eye, and the frequency of injections depends on the individual patient's response to the treatment.

Another treatment option for neovascular AMD is photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT involves the injection of a light-sensitive dye into the bloodstream, followed by the application of a laser to activate the dye. This laser treatment selectively targets and destroys the abnormal blood vessels, helping to reduce leakage and preserve vision. PDT is often used in combination with anti-VEGF therapy for better outcomes.

The specific treatment plan for you will depend on factors such as the stage and severity of your AMD, your overall health, and your preferences. Your retinal specialist will discuss the available options with you and recommend the most appropriate treatment approach based on your individual situation.

It is important to note that while treatment can help to stabilize or improve vision in many cases of neovascular AMD, it may not always be possible to fully restore lost vision. However, early diagnosis and timely treatment can significantly reduce the risk of further vision loss and help preserve your remaining vision.",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,,96,"I am a patient with neovascular age-related macular degeneration in the right eye who had sudden loss of vision two weeks ago, without prior treatment with 20/60 vision: when will treatment start and what does it involve?",About treatment for wet AMD,Patient treated or to be treated

You can receive this treatment at a hospital with a dedicated ophthalmology department or at a specialized retina center. The drug is injected in the eye with a fine needle. Minimal discomfort is to be expected. The procedure takes five to seven minutes, but the injection itself is over in less than 20 seconds. The injection is given with you lying down comfortably on the couch. Local anaesthetic drops are applied to numb your eye and minimize discomfort. Your eyelids and surface of the eye are cleaned to prevent infection. Your face and the area around your eye will be covered by a drape to keep the area sterile. A small clip (speculum) will be used to keep the eye open. Further anaesthetic and antibiotic drops are put into the eye. The injection site is marked with callipers and a few seconds later, the injection is given. Your vision is assessed post injection by checking hand movements or counting fingers and a final lot of antibiotic drops are instilled.
",Reviewer 2,"Anti-VEGF injections are a commonly used treatment for conditions such as neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). VEGF, or Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, is a protein that promotes the growth of new blood vessels. In certain conditions, like neovascular AMD, excessive VEGF leads to the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the eye, which can leak fluid and cause scarring and vision loss.

Here's a basic rundown of the injection process:

1. Preparation: You'll be seated comfortably in a reclining chair or lying down. The area around your eye will be cleaned thoroughly to minimize infection risk.

2. Numbing the Eye: Anesthetic eye drops are used to numb the surface of the eye. This helps to make the procedure more comfortable.

3. Antiseptic: Additional antiseptic drops may be applied to further assure the cleanliness of the eye prior to injection.

4. Eyelid Holder: A small device called a speculum can be used to ensure your eyelids remain open throughout the procedure to prevent blinking.

5. The Injection: The doctor will then use a very fine, small needle to deliver the anti-VEGF medication into the vitreous, which is the jelly-like substance inside of your eye. You might feel some pressure, but it shouldn't be painful.

6. Post-Injection: Once the injection has been completed, the doctor will remove the speculum. Your eye will be cleaned again, and antibiotic drops may be applied to prevent infection.

7. Recovery: You could experience some minor discomfort, eyelid drooping, redness, or feeling like something is in the eye for a few hours after the injection.

Remember to follow-up with your doctor post-injection and attend all scheduled appointments. You should report any unusual symptoms or worsening of your condition immediately. 

This should ease your worries about the procedure but make sure you communicate with your healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns. Remember every patient and case is unique, so the process may vary slightly or more steps could be involved. F.INTERESANT - CHAT GP...

The injection process typically involves the following steps:

- Dilation of the pupil: The doctor will use eye drops to dilate the pupil, making it larger and easier to see the back of the eye.

- Numbing the eye: The doctor will inject a local anesthetic around the eye to numb the area and prevent discomfort during the procedure.

- Cleaning the eye: The doctor will clean the surface of the eye with an antiseptic solution to reduce the risk of infection.

- Inserting the needle: The doctor will use a thin needle to inject the anti-VEGF medication into the vitreous humor, the clear fluid that fills the back of the eye.

- Applying pressure: After the injection, the doctor will apply pressure to the injection site to help stop any bleeding.

- Monitoring the eye: The doctor will monitor the eye for any signs of complications, such as bleeding or infection.

Particularly in neovascular AMD you should avoid any delay as it can lead to rapid and severe vision loss if not addressed promptly. Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) may be partially reversible with intravitreal injection therapy using anti-VEGF agents (e.g. aflibercept, bevacizumab, ranibizumab). This is the most effective way to manage neovascular AMD and represents the first line-treatment. The primary goal of anti-VEGF agents, injected intravitreally, is to block the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the eye to prevent visual loss and, in some instances, improve vision. Anti-VEGF therapy is generally well tolerated and rarely associated with serious adverse events. However, its efficacy seems highly dependent on an early diagnosis of neovascular lesions before major retinal damage has occurred. An eye with almost any level of vision may benefit, although better visual acuity at the outset is associated with a better final visual acuity.
",Reviewer 2,"I'm sorry to hear about your situation. Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) can significantly impact your vision, but there are treatments available that can slow the disease's progress and even improve vision in some cases.

The primary treatment for nAMD is anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy. This involves regular injections into the eye to reduce the growth of abnormal blood vessels and slow leakage, both of which damage the macula. Studies have shown that anti-VEGF therapy can stabilize vision in about 90% of people with nAMD, and about one-third of people see an improvement in vision.

However, success can vary depending on the individual and factors such as how advanced the condition is at the time of treatment and how consistently treatments are received. Also, keep in mind that while these treatments can be very effective, they're not a cure for nAMD. They're designed to manage and control symptoms, not eliminate the disease entirely.

It's very important to start treatment as soon as possible after diagnosis in order to maximize results. Regular follow-up visits are necessary to monitor the disease and treatment response.

If you're considering treatment, you should discuss your specific situation, including the risks and benefits, with your eye care specialist or ophthalmologist. They can provide the most accurate and personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

1. Improved vision: Treatment can help to improve vision and restore some of the vision that has been lost.

2. Reduced risk of further vision loss: Treatment can help to reduce the risk of further vision loss and prevent the condition from progressing to a more severe stage.

3. Improved quality of life: Treatment can help to improve the quality of life by making it easier to perform daily activities such as reading, driving, and watching TV.

The success of treatment for neovascular AMD with sudden loss of vision depends on a number of factors, including the stage of the condition, the type of treatment used, and the individual patient's response to treatment.

In general, the earlier the treatment is started, the better the chances of success. Treatment can be most effective if started within the first few weeks of vision loss.

The type of treatment used will also affect the success of treatment. There are a number of different treatment options available for neovascular AMD, including anti-VEGF injections, laser therapy, and photodynamic therapy. The best treatment option for each individual patient will depend on the specific characteristics of their condition.

The individual patient's response to treatment will also play a role in the success of treatment. Some patients respond better to treatment than others. In some cases, treatment may not be effective in restoring vision or preventing further vision loss.

Overall, the benefits of treatment for neovascular AMD with sudden loss of vision outweigh the risks. Treatment can help to improve vision, reduce the risk of further vision loss, and improve the quality of life.

",Reviewer 2,"Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a severe form of the disease that can result in significant vision loss. However, treatment options like the injections of Bevacizumab, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF), can slow the progression of the disease.

The treatment benefits include but are not limited to:

1. Reducing the progression of AMD: Anti-VEGF medications can help slow down or even stop the disease from progressing further. This does not necessarily mean improvement in vision but can help retain the current state of vision.

2. Temporary or long-term vision stabilization: Some patients may experience stabilization of their vision as the leakage from abnormal blood vessels under the macula are reduced. 

3. Potential Visual improvement: In some cases, patients have improved visual acuity following anti-VEGF therapy, although it's not common.

Now, regarding the treatment's effectiveness:

Effectiveness of treatment with anti-VEGF injections can vary widely between individuals due to multiple factors such as the stage of the disease, overall health, responsiveness to the medication, and adherence to treatment protocols. In clinical trials, more than 90 percent of patients maintained their vision with monthly treatment. About one-third of subjects even experienced visual improvement.

Your current condition indicates active signs of the disease along with a disciform scar on the macula, which may affect your visual prognosis. A disciform scar is a mark left by neovascular AMD after the abnormal blood vessels under the retina have bled or leaked fluid. This bleeding or leakage can lead to scarring and result in permanent vision loss.

However, continued treatment may help to control the disease and potentially stall further vision loss. It's essential to discuss this in detail with your ophthalmologist, considering your past response to treatment and current visual and OCT status. It’s important to manage expectations as vision loss due to scarring is generally irreversible.

Anti-VEGF agents inhibit the growth of new blood vessels and reduce leakage from existing blood vessels, which can lead to improved vision and a reduction in the risk of vision loss.

Bevacizumab (Avastin) is an anti-VEGF agent that has been shown to be effective in treating neovascular AMD. In a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, bevacizumab was found to be as effective as ranibizumab (Lucentis), another anti-VEGF agent, in improving vision and reducing the risk of vision loss in patients with neovascular AMD.

The benefits of anti-VEGF therapy for neovascular AMD include:

* Improved vision: Anti-VEGF therapy can help to improve vision in patients with neovascular AMD. In the study mentioned above, bevacizumab was found to improve vision by an average of 9.5 letters on the ETDRS vision chart.
* Reduced risk of vision loss: Anti-VEGF therapy can help to reduce the risk of vision loss in patients with neovascular AMD. In the study mentioned above, bevacizumab was found to reduce the risk of vision loss by 50%.
* Fewer injections: Anti-VEGF therapy can be given less frequently than other treatments for neovascular AMD, such as laser therapy. This can be a benefit for patients who do not want to have to come in for frequent injections.

The success of anti-VEGF therapy for neovascular AMD depends on a number of factors, including the stage of the disease, the patient's overall health, and the response to treatment. In general, anti-VEGF therapy is most effective in patients who are diagnosed with neovascular AMD early and who have good overall health.

It works by interfering with the ability of platelets to stick together and form clots. 

For patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) who are scheduled to receive an intravitreal anti-VEGF injection, the decision of whether or not to discontinue Plavix prior to the injection should be made in consultation with the patient's doctor. In some cases, the doctor may recommend discontinuing Plavix a few days before the injection to reduce the risk of bleeding during the procedure. However, in other cases, the doctor may decide that the risk of stopping Plavix outweighs the risk of bleeding, and may recommend that the patient continue taking the medication. 

The decision of whether or not to discontinue Plavix prior to an intravitreal anti-VEGF injection is a complex one that should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the patient's individual medical history and risk factors.

After a period of 2 years, the frequency of intravitreal injections for neovascular AMD depends on several factors: the response to treatment (benefit of anti-VEGF agents is only likely in the presence of active disease; if your neovascular AMD is controlled and there are no signs of disease activity on OCT, the time between injections could be extended), compliance to the treatment and appointments follow-ups and risk of recurrence.
",Reviewer 2,"Frequency of intravitreal injections for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is generally determined based on a patient's specific condition and response to medication. It may be possible to adjust the frequency of your injections, but this type of decision can only be made by your treating ophthalmologist. He or she will be best equipped to assess your visual stability, symptom management, and overall health status. It's crucial to have this discussion with your eye doctor since less frequent treatment for neovascular AMD could potentially lead to worsening of disease if not cautiously monitored. 

Each patient's treatment plan is individualized, and your eye health professional can help guide you through the decision process. Your doctor will be able to explain more clearly how often you need this treatment and why, as they have your medical history, your examination, and imaging. Nonetheless, it's important to remember that regular injections are typically necessary to maintain vision and control the condition in AMD patients. Not receiving injections as often as recommended by your doctor could lead to vision loss.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0," Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of sight loss in the developed world. It is characterised by the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for detailed vision. These blood vessels can leak fluid and blood, damaging the macula and leading to vision loss.

Anti-VEGF injections are a type of treatment for AMD that can help to prevent vision loss. VEGF is a protein that promotes the growth of new blood vessels. By blocking VEGF, these injections can help to stop the growth of new blood vessels and reduce leakage from existing ones.

Aflibercept is one type of anti-VEGF injection that is used to treat AMD. It is typically given every 2 months, but the frequency of injections can be adjusted depending on the individual patient's response to treatment.

In some cases, it may be possible to reduce the frequency of aflibercept injections to every 3 or 4 months. This is usually done if the patient has a good response to treatment and their vision is stable. However, it is important to note that reducing the frequency of injections can increase the risk of the AMD getting worse. Therefore, it is important to discuss the risks and benefits of reducing the frequency of injections with your doctor.

If you are considering reducing the frequency of your aflibercept injections, it is important to talk to your doctor first.

Particularly in neovascular AMD you should avoid any delay as it can lead to rapid and severe vision loss if not addressed promptly. Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) may be partially reversible with intravitreal injection therapy using anti-VEGF agents. This is the most effective way to manage neovascular AMD and represents the first line-treatment. The treatment goals would be to block the growth of new and abnormal blood vessels in the eye and prevent additional visual loss or, in some instances, improve central vision. Anti-VEGF treatments are highly successful in preventing wet AMD associated vision loss and up to 90% of people experience vision stabilization. Caught early enough, up to 30% of patients with neovascular AMD may even regain some lost vision. However, results can widely vary between individuals, while some patients respond very well, others may experience more modest improvements.
",Reviewer 2,"Treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration, commonly with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections, has shown significant success rates in terms of slowing disease progression and stabilizing vision. However, the success rates can vary between patients, and not everyone may experience improvement. Some studies show that approximately one-third of patients have improved vision, one-third have stabilized vision and one-third continue to lose vision despite treatment. 

Keep in mind, the timing of treatment initiation can also influence the outcome; earlier treatment typically leads to better results. However, given that your loss of vision occurred recently (two weeks ago), there might still be a good chance for successful treatment. It's very important to discuss these specifics with your healthcare provider or ophthalmologist, as they will be able to provide you with the most accurate information based on your personal medical history and condition.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0," The success rates of treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) depend on several factors, including the stage of the disease, the type of treatment, and the individual patient's response. 

Anti-VEGF injections, such as Lucentis, Eylea, or Avastin, are commonly used to treat neovascular AMD. These injections can help to stop the growth of new blood vessels and reduce leakage from existing blood vessels, which can help to preserve vision and prevent further damage to the macula. 

For patients with sudden loss of vision due to neovascular AMD, the success rates of treatment can vary. In general, the earlier the treatment is started, the better the chances of preserving vision. 

One study found that among patients with sudden vision loss due to neovascular AMD, those who received anti-VEGF injections within 7 days of symptom onset had a 70% chance of recovering some vision. However, those who received treatment after 7 days had only a 30% chance of recovering vision. 

Overall, the success rates of treatment for neovascular AMD are generally good, with many patients experiencing significant improvement in their vision.

The treatment goals in your case would be to block the growth of new and abnormal blood vessels in the eye, prevent any additional visual loss and, in some instances, improve central vision and quality of life. An eye with almost any level of vision may benefit, although better visual acuity at the outset is associated with a better final visual acuity and patients with only ‘hand movements’ should be assessed on an individual basis. The presence of a macular disciform scar suggests that significant structural damage has occurred and this may significantly limit the potential for visual improvement.
",Reviewer 2,"Your condition is complex and indeed requires specialized care. The success rate of treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration can vary greatly depending on a multitude of factors including the stage of the disease, the individual's overall health, adherence to treatment, and response to medication among other things. 

Anti-VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) injections such as Bevacizumab are used to slow the disease progression by inhibiting the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the retina. The success rate here typically refers to the stabilization or slowing down of the disease progression rather than a complete cure as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a chronic disease.

Regarding the specific success rates, the phase III MARINA and ANCHOR trials for ranibizumab, another Anti-VEGF agent used in AMD, showed that 90%-95% of patients achieved stabilization (defined as losing <15 letters on the visual acuity chart) over 1 to 2 years of monthly treatment.

However, therapeutic response can vary. It's also important to note that in advanced stages of AMD where disciform scar is present, vision loss might be irreversible. Therefore, it's less likely for visual acuity to improve significantly with injections.

Please continue to work closely with your healthcare provider or retina specialist to manage your condition. They will be able to provide the most accurate and personalized information based on your particular case.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0," According to a study published in the American Journal of Ophthalmology, the success rate of anti-VEGF injections for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is approximately 95% at one year. This means that 95% of patients who receive anti-VEGF injections will experience some improvement in their vision. However, it is important to note that the success rate of anti-VEGF injections can vary depending on the individual patient's condition. Some patients may experience more improvement than others, and some patients may not experience any improvement at all.

In your case, you have a macular disciform scar with sign of disease activity on Ocular Coherence Tomography and hand motion vision. This means that you have a relatively advanced stage of nAMD. However, you are still likely to benefit from anti-VEGF injections. The injections can help to stop the growth of new blood vessels and reduce the amount of fluid in the retina. This can lead to an improvement in vision.

The success rate of anti-VEGF injections for patients with macular disciform scar and hand motion vision is approximately 70% at one year. This means that 70% of patients who receive anti-VEGF injections will experience some improvement in their vision. However, it is important to note that the success rate can vary depending on the individual patient's condition. Some patients may experience more improvement than others, and some patients may not experience any improvement at all.

If you are considering anti-VEGF injections, it is important to talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of the treatment. The injections can be very effective, but there are also some potential side effects. These side effects can include pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site. In rare cases, anti-VEGF injections can lead to more serious side effects, such as infection or retinal detachment.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to receive anti-VEGF injections is a personal one.

It is the leading cause of sight loss in the UK and US. There are two main types of AMD: dry AMD and wet AMD. Dry AMD is the most common type and it affects the light-sensitive cells in the macula, which is the part of the eye responsible for central vision. Wet AMD is less common but more serious, and it occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula and leak blood and fluid. 

It is important to have your eyes checked regularly if you have AMD, as early detection and treatment can help to prevent sight loss. The frequency with which you should have your eyes checked will depend on the stage of your AMD. If you have early AMD, you should have your eyes checked at least once a year. If you have intermediate AMD, you should have your eyes checked every 6 months. If you have wet AMD, you will need to have your eyes checked more frequently, possibly every 4-6 weeks. 

In addition to regular eye exams, there are a number of other things you can do to help prevent AMD from progressing, including: 

- Wearing sunglasses when you are outdoors to protect your eyes from the sun's harmful UV rays
- Eating a healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains
- Exercising regularly

The frequency of your eye exams will depend on the severity of your AMD and the recommendations of your ophthalmologist.

In general, people with neovascular AMD should have their eyes checked every 1-2 months. This may involve a dilated eye exam, which allows the ophthalmologist to see the back of the eye and check for any changes in the macula. The ophthalmologist may also recommend other tests, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), which can provide a detailed image of the macula.

If your AMD is stable, your ophthalmologist may recommend less frequent eye exams. However, if your AMD is progressing, you may need to have your eyes checked more often. It is important to follow your ophthalmologist's recommendations for eye exams so that you can receive the best possible care for your AMD.

In addition to regular eye exams, it is also important to take steps to protect your eyes from further damage. This includes wearing sunglasses when you are outdoors, avoiding smoking, and eating a healthy diet that is rich in fruits and vegetables. By following these steps, you can help to slow the progression of AMD and preserve your vision.",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,,137,I am a patient with neovascular age-related macular degeneration in the right eye: how often should I have my eyes checked?,Contacting your eye health professional,Patient diagnosed

In GA, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the photoreceptors in the macula deteriorate, leading to the loss of central vision. 

There is currently no cure for GA, but early detection and management can help to preserve vision and slow the progression of the disease. 

For patients with geographic atrophy, it is important to have regular eye exams to monitor the condition and check for any changes. The frequency of these exams will depend on the stage of the disease and the individual's risk factors. 

In general, patients with GA should have their eyes checked at least once or twice a year. However, if the disease is progressing rapidly or if the patient has other risk factors, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, more frequent exams may be necessary. 

During an eye exam, the doctor will check the patient's visual acuity, the health of the retina, and the presence of any new or worsening lesions. The doctor may also recommend additional tests, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), to get a more detailed view of the retina.
